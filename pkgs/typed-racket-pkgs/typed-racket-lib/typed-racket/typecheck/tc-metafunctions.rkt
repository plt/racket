;; abstract-results
;;
;; Given results from the range of a lambda, abstract any
;; identifier objects into index (numeric) objects. This is effectively
;; doing a kind of De Bruijn indexing for objects.
;;
;; When the body of a lambda is type-checked, its filters and object
;; may refer to variables that are in scope in that body. Since these
;; names are not in scope outside of the lambda, the type of the function
;; will instead store their De Bruijn indices.
;;
;; For example, given the function
;;
;;   (λ (x) (number? x))
;;
;; the typechecker will check the body and return
;;
;;   Boolean ; N_x | !N_x ; ∅
;;
;; but the `x`s have to be converted to indices to get the type
;;
;;      N_(0,0) | !N_(0,0)
;; Any -------------------> Boolean
;;              ∅
;;
;; where the index (0,0) indicates the first argument of
;; the current function
;;
;; Comparatively, a curried predicate like
;;
;;   (λ (x) (λ (y)(number? x)))
;;
;; gets the type
;;
;;             N_(1,0) | !N_(1,0)
;; Any -> Any -------------------> Boolean
;;                     ∅
;;
;; (ignoring filters on the first arrow)
;; where the index (1,0) indicates the first argument of
;; the enclosing lambda.
;;
;; The paper "Logical Types for Untyped Languages" takes a different
;; approach where all function types carry their names, so that the first
;; example would have the type:
;;
;;        N_x | !N_x
;; x:Any ------------> Boolean
;;            ∅
;;
;; See tc-subst.rkt for the functions that take an abstracted function
;; type and substitute in a concrete object.
